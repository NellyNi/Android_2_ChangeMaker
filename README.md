*I've done the Extra Credit part with percent layout and guidelines, and I deleted the two extra xml files for the other size of screen. Now I only have 2 xml files (one for landscape and the other one for portrait). 

*I run the APP well on a Pixel XL phone(large), a Nexus 7 tablet(large), a Nexus 10 tablet(xlarge), 4 WVGA Nexus S(normal), and a 3.4 WQVGA(small).

*I set the font size in the styles.xml instead of creating a new sizes.xml.

*My App would stop if the input total price is larger than 10E7. I asked Professor and he said that would be fine.
